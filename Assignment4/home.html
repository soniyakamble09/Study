        <p>Data Structures together with Algorithms: 
           DSA is about finding efficient ways to store and retrieve data, to perform operations on data, 
           and to solve specific problems. By understanding DSA, you can: 
           Decide which data structure or algorithm is best for a given situation. 
           Make programs that run faster or use less memory.

            Data Science: 
            When I use the term Data Science, I mean basics of Machine Learning and SQL. 
            While some companies do ask questions on these in tests as well, 
            most of the questions on these are asked in the interviews and you need to prepare for them.

            Machine Learning: 
            The Machine Learning course offered by Andrew NG on Coursera provides a basic overview 
            of majority concepts in Machine Learning. It is not only a must, but also sufficient 
            to get you through majority of the interviews. The only problem is this course does 
            not cover Decision Trees (DTrees), which is a very basic yet very powerful concept in ML. 
            So you should go through some online resources covering DTress and its basics too.
        </p>
        <p>
            SQL: There are some very short and useful courses covering SQL on Kaggle. 
            You should go through both basic and advanced SQL and that would be it.

            Interviews:
            While discussing interview preparation at length will require another article by itself, 
            which I am hoping to write sometime soon, a small paragraph here should get you an idea. 
            Things that are required for interviews are already mentioned. 
            You might be asked a coding question, the difficult of which can vary. 
            But since you’re prepared for that, no worries here. 
            Puzzles are definitely a part of most of the interviews and you need to practice on enough of them, 
            to develop a thought process for these. Finally, few questions on data science can also be asked, 
            but most likely, they are going to be very basic ones. 
            Some of us are lucky enough to get selected in the first interview we appear for, 
            while others maybe not so. And if your interviews are scheduled back to back, 
            poor performance in one can lead to mental stress which will ensure poorer performance in next interview too, 
            and the cycle would perpetuate. 
            Therefore, it is of paramount importance that you don’t let the results of previous 
            interviews hurt your performance in the present or coming interviews.
